This dashboard is currently under development. It will be finished by 2026-05-30.
:::

This dashboard showcases developed workflows within [the B-cubed project](https://b-cubed.eu/case-studies) for the region of Flanders, a region of Europe where species occurrence data are abundant.

The implemented indicators in this dashboard can be subdivided into:

-   General biodiversity indicators (based on [b3gbi](https://github.com/b-cubed-eu/b3gbi), for instance, cumulative species richness, relative species richness, etc.);

-   Phylogenetic indicators (based on [pdindicatoR](https://github.com/b-cubed-eu/pdindicator));

-   Invasive Alien Species indicators (based on [impIndicator](https://github.com/b-cubed-eu/impindicator), [TRIAS](https://trias-project.github.io/indicators/) and [b3alien](https://pypi.org/project/b3alien/))
